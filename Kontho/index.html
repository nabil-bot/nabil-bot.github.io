		<h2>Installation</h2>
		<p>
			System requirements for our application include a <b>Windows</b> operating system <b>version 8 or above</b>, with a minimum of <b>4 GB of RAM</b> and <b>400 MB of available disk space</b>. These requirements are necessary to ensure optimal performance and usability of the application. Please ensure that your system meets these requirements before attempting to install and use our application.<br>
			
			<b>Please note that</b> if you wish to install the BETA version of our application using the custom installer, it may be necessary to temporarily turn off the real-time protection feature of Windows Defender during the installation process. This is because the installation package includes some necessary fonts that may trigger a false positive warning by Windows Defender, which can interfere with the installation process.

Additionally, the custom installer will automatically create a shortcut to the application on your desktop and in your Programs folder for ease of access.

<br>We recommend that you turn the real-time protection feature of Windows Defender back on after installation to ensure continued system protection.
