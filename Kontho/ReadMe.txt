📧Message from the Developer.
This was my school project that I began working on during the pandemic in 2020. Aimed at automating🚀 my daily tasks. The first release was in 2021, and now thousands of people are using it. There's still a long way to go. I'm the only one working on it, so I'd really appreciate any feedback to make it better.🔥

🔵FAQ👇
🔷Why do I have to pay for the Access Plus edition❓
💠Because Google Cloud API is not free‼💲

🔷Why is the website link like this❓
💠The website link appears this way because it's my personal GitHub repository, and this isn't a commercial application.

🔷Why do some antivirus software flag this app❓
💠Applications of this nature require a code signature certificate to facilitate distribution without encountering flagging issues.😓 As an individual without organizational backing, navigating this process can be challenging. Nevertheless, I am diligently making every effort to overcome these obstacles.💦
